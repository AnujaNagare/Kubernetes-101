What is a Cloud Native Microservices?

- Cloud-native microservices refer to an application design strategy in which developers divide applications into a series of discrete units, called microservices. 
- Cloud-native microservices are designed to be scalable, highly available, and easy to manage.
- Each microservice can typically operate independently of the others, but the microservices share data and interact over a network to enable application functionality.
- Microservices are inherently cloud-native, because cloud-native apps are based on microservices architectures
- Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model.


Kubernetes can be thought of as a Cluster / Application Orchestrator.


Kubernetes Cluster

- A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. 
- Every cluster has at least one worker node. The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. 
- The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.
