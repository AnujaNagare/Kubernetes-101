What is a Cloud Native Microservices?

- Cloud-native microservices refer to an application design strategy in which developers divide applications into a series of discrete units, called microservices. 

- Cloud-native microservices are designed to be scalable, highly available, and easy to manage.

- Each microservice can typically operate independently of the others, but the microservices share data and interact over a network to enable application functionality.

- Microservices are inherently cloud-native, because cloud-native apps are based on microservices architectures

- Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model.
